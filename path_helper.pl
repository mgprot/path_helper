=head1 NAME

path_helper.pl - improvement on Apple's /usr/libexec/path_helper

=head1 SYNOPSIS

path_helper.pl [-c] [-s] [-v] [<path file>...]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

With Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard), Apple introduced a program to help people set up
their PATH environment variable. Sadly, the program from Apple is very limited.

This perl script adds the ability to specify the names of files and the order
in which they should be read in addition to Apple's standard directories:
C</etc/paths.d> and C</etc/manpaths.d>

As with all PATH settings, care should be taken to ensure that 'important'
paths are specified first. Also, you should B<NEVER> have C<.> (the current
directory) in your path $PATH - it I<WILL> bite you one day if you do!

=head2 Features:

=over

* automatic shell detection

* removal of duplicate paths

* removal of non-existing paths

* automatic detection of related man paths

* inclusion of existing PATH and MANPATH variables

=back

=head1 USAGE

=head2 For sh, bash, ksh and zsh users:

    if [ -x /path/to/path_helper.pl ]
    then
        eval `/path/to/path_helper.pl`    # use -s if you get an error
    fi

=head2 For csh and tcsh users:

    if( -x /path/to/path_helper.pl ) then
        eval `/path/to/path_helper.pl`   # add -c if you get an error
    endif

=head1 OPTIONS

=over

=item -c

Produce c-shell style C<setenv> commands.

=item -s

Produce sh style C<export> commands.

=item -v

Be verbose when removing duplicate and/or non-existent paths.
